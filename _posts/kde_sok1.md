Finally, I am going to write about my experience as a student of Season of KDE 2020. A winter learning new things, learning what matters is not just writing code but writing good code. I would like to thank GCompris and KDE for giving me such an opportunity to be a part of the community and to try to bring happiness to people and kids using it around the world. 



I had to complete the following tasks during this period:

1. Improve multiple datasets of clock game activity.
2. Add multiple datasets to balance scales.
3. Add multiple datasets to balance scale with kgs.
4. Add multiple datasets to balance scales with ounce.

Since few weeks are still left for SoK to come to an end. Till now, I have completed the following tasks:

1. Implemented new multiple datasets to clock game activity which got merged to the multiple_dataset branch.
2. Added multiple datasets to balance scales activity which is under review by the mentors.
3. Added multiple datasets to balance scales with kgs activity which is under review by the mentors.

### Clockgame Activity:
I started my work on this activity. The goal of this activity is to teach a child how to see the clock. Initially, this activity contains dataset only with two different level selections. I have added the multiple dataset to this activity with 5 different level selections to better fit to the french school learning programs.

I have also added a OK button to check the answer. Finally, the datasets has been merged to multiple_dataset branch.

### Balance scales activity:
This activity goal is to teach the child about the arithemetic calculation by balancing the scales of different weights. The balance scales activity has 3 sub activities as mentioned above:

1. Adding multiple datasets to balance scales.
2. Adding multiple datasets to balance scales with kgs.
3. Adding multiple datasets to balance scales with ounce.

I have added multiple datasets to balance scales and balance scales with kgs which is under review by the mentors.

I am left with the following work which I would complete in the coming weeks.

1. To add multiple datasets to balance scale with ounce.
2. Test the activities on a different platforms.

I am thankful to my mentor Johnny Jazeix and Emmanuel Charruau for giving me this opportunity and helping me always during the SoK period. I have learned a lot of things during this period and have a great learning experience as of development coding. I am looking forward to add multiple datasets to other activities after the end of the SoK period.
