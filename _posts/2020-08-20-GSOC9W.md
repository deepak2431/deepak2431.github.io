title: Multiple Datasets to GCompris Memory Game Activities
category: Tech
---

In the past blogs, I wrote about the status of my GSoC work. Following the same in this blog I would love to update about my one of my major project milestone I have achieved.

So, Let's dive in :)

### Brief about the memory game activities

The memory game activities helps the child to practice different arithemetic operations, counting, recongnizing different animal images and audios. There are a lot of 20 memory activities with different goals and fun learning experience for the child.

### What I need to do?

I need to add multiple datasets to about 15 memory activities. The memory activities to which I need to add multiple datasets are as follows:

1. Enumeration memory game
2. Addition memory game (Both modes)
3. Subtraction memory game (Both modes)
4. Multiplication memory game (Both modes)
5. Division memory game (Both modes)
6. Addition and subtraction memory game (Both modes)
7. Multiplication and division memory game (Both modes)
8. All operations memory game (Both modes)
