title: GSoC'20 Wrapping up Community Bonding Period
category: Tech
---

Hey everyone,

As the coding period of GSoC is going to begin in the next 2 days. In this blog, I am going to write all about what I did during the community bonding period.

During this period I have interacted with my mentors and finalized the multiple datasets of a few activities. Recently, the GCompris project has been moved to GitLab so I set up my account over there and also asked my mentors how can I push my branches to the server and everything else. I have also gone through the code of the memory activities and planned about the resources I will be using. I have also set up my environment as to how to test the GCompris on the android platform. I plan to start my work with the enumeration memory game activity so I have created a branch for it and pushed it to the server.

As to sum up I am all ready to begin my coding period now. Hope I would be having a great time ahead.

I will be updating my progress regularly through blogs.

Thanks!!<br>
