Hey everyone,

In the previous blog I wrote about my GSoC first evaluation. In this blog I have written about the activities on which I have worked further to add multiple datasets.

I have added multiple datasets to three activities after GSoC first evaluation. Among them two have been merged to the master branch and one of them is still under review. 

### Division memory game

In this activity, the child needs to turn the cards to match a division and it's result, until all cards are gone. This activity helps the child to practice division. The activity is one of the sub-activity of memory activities.<br>
The procedure of adding multiple datasets to this activity is the same as that of other memory activities. We just need to create different Data.qml files in the resource directory and load the datasets. For this activity, we need to use the function getDivTable() implemented in math_util.js and pass the arguments for the respective numbers as ranging from 1-10. There are a total of 10 multiple datasets for this activity.<br>
This activity also has two modes. The first mode is the one in which the child needs to turn the cards and match with the equivalent division result. The second mode is the one in which the child needs to play with Tux to match the equivalent cards, as this mode is called "with Tux". I have implemented multiple datasets for both of the modes. The dataset content of the activity Division memory game with Tux is the same as without Tux.

After the addition of multiple datasets to both of the modes, I tested it manually to make sure it works perfectly without any regression. This activity has been merged into the master branch.

Below image shows the multiple datasets content of this activity

### Addition and Subtraction memory game

In this activity, the child needs to turn the cards to match addition and subtraction and it's result until all cards are gone. This activity is also one of the sub-activity of memory activities. For all the previous memory activities based on the arithmetic operation, the level was based on the only single arithmetic operation. While this memory activity has two different operations like addition and subtraction both for a particular level. As in case of this activity for any level, there would be few cards on addition operation and few of them upon subtraction.<br>
The dataset addition procedure for this activity is also similar to other memory activities. We just need to use the getAddMinusTable() function from math_util.js.<br>
There are a total of 10 multiple datasets for this activity. This activity also has two modes as one with Tux and another without Tux. I have implemented multiple datasets to both modes of the activity.<br>
After the addition of datasets, I tested it manually and made a merge request for it. This activity has been merged into the master branch.


Thanks!<br>
